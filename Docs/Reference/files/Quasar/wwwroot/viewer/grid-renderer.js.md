# Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/grid-renderer.js

**Module:** Quasar.Host  **Kind:** JS  **Tier:** 3

## Summary
Main renderer for grid and asteroid viewer scenes. It computes centered floor-grid alignment from block integer footprint parity, centers standalone voxel scenes on the selected asteroid bounds, de-duplicates top-level and subpart light-source metadata before creating capped point/spot lights, selects a four-light projected-shadow budget for reflector spot lights, marks model/proxy grid geometry for shadow casting and receiving, displays instanced proxy batches while local MWM models resolve with bounded parallelism, resolves local armor skin texture overrides from `ArmorModifiers.sbc`, resolves glass and transparent LCD screen-area material names through `TransparentMaterials.sbc`, applies a viewer-side approximation of Space Engineers transparent material constants for glass opacity/color/gloss, applies transparent gloss maps as roughness-only inputs instead of normal maps, applies LCD material replacement and placeholder behavior, progressively rebuilds the model layer with adaptive throttling, builds instanced batches for shared model/material combinations, applies Space Engineers-style material paint, handles cutout/blended transparency, procedurally meshes voxel content/material chunks when present with scalar-field gradient normals aligned to mesher winding, renders standalone asteroid voxel terrain without floor clipping, renders voxel terrain visually double-sided without forced reverse-face shadow rendering, and progressively loads selected material textures without blocking scene construction.

## Structure

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `renderGridScene(scene)` | Replaces the active grid/voxel scene, computes floor-grid footprint alignment, resolves models, initializes progressive texture stats, creates batches/proxies, updates bounds/camera, and refreshes summary/stat fields. |

Internal sections cover relative grid-view transforms, standalone voxel centering and bounds setup, captured point/spot light creation under the grid group, deterministic projected spot-light shadow selection and shadow-camera setup, immediate proxy-first rendering, local armor skin and transparent material definition parsing, Space Engineers glass opacity/alpha remapping and transparent shader constants, transparent `GlossTexture` alpha sampling without RGB normal perturbation, adaptively delayed model layer rebuilds for larger scenes, painted instanced proxy solids with batched cuboid edge outlines, voxel data chunk iso-surface generation from content/material samples using `PositionLeftBottomCorner` world positions before grid-relative conversion, scalar-field gradient normal interpolation and normal-facing polygon orientation for generated voxel terrain, clipped voxel chunk/polygon statistics for grid-adjacent terrain outside the viewer footprint or reduced to a one-sample-thick range, diagnostic logging for non-renderable chunks, voxel proxy fallback rendering, full-matrix block model transforms with legacy `ModelOffset` fallback, model-part/subpart mesh creation, shared geometry/material caches per rebuild, active LCD material replacement, Space Engineers-style paint/color-mask shader injection, alpha-mask cutout discard and polygon depth offset for `DECAL_CUTOUT` materials, depth-write-disabled blended rendering for glass/holo/shield materials, instanced batch flushing, bounded-concurrency model resolution, texture metadata collection, and progressive texture load status tracking.

## Notes
Texture counts start from scene/model metadata, then found/missing/loaded/failed counters update as visible/shared materials request textures. Captured Space Engineers light falloff is inverted when mapped to Three.js decay so lower in-game falloff values produce tighter viewer lights. Top-level scene lights and per-subpart light records are de-duplicated before rendering and stats updates. Projected/reflector spot lights can cast shadows under a four-light cap; point lights and reflector companion fill lights stay non-shadow-casting. Unresolved block proxies are emitted as a small number of instanced solid batches and line-edge batches grouped by opacity rather than one proxy mesh per block, which reduces the temporary draw-call cost on large grids while preserving per-block hover metadata through `InstancedMesh.userData.blocks`. Model resolution runs with a wider worker cap, and progressive rebuilds wait for a threshold of completed models or a scene-size-dependent timeout before rebuilding.

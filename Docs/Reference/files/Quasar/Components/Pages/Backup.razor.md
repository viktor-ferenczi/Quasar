# Quasar/Components/Pages/Backup.razor

**Module:** Quasar.Components  **Kind:** Blazor component  **Tier:** 2

## Summary
Routable page (`@page "/backup"`) for configuring the stored-backup folder and creating, restoring, scheduling, and managing Quasar configuration, server, and world backups. Gated by `@attribute [Authorize(Policy = QuasarPolicyNames.CanManageSecurity)]` and `@implements IDisposable`.

## Structure
Namespace: `Quasar.Components.Pages`

Injected: `QuasarBackupService BackupService`, `QuasarBackupSettingsService BackupSettingsService`, `AutomaticBackupService AutomaticBackup`, `DedicatedServerCatalog ServerCatalog`, `DedicatedServerSupervisor Supervisor`, `WebServiceOptions WebServiceOptions`, `ISnackbar`, `IDialogService`.

UI sections (`MudGrid`):
1. **Create & restore** — "Create backup" links to `/api/backup/download`; restore via `MudFileUpload` (`.zip`, max 10 GB) → `RestoreFromUploadAsync`; shows the last restore-report alert with a restart recommendation. Explains that Quasar configuration backups cover app settings/catalog data, while server backups cover non-cache runtime state and world backups cover save files.
2. **Version compatibility** — same major.minor restores fully, older is upgraded via forward migration, newer is rejected; data-protection keys are excluded so the Steam Workshop API key is re-entered on a different machine.
3. **Server & world backups** — sortable table populated from `DedicatedServerCatalog`, one row per server, with action buttons packed in the left column, unique name packed next to them, and display name growing at the end. Each row has Back up server (`AutomaticBackup.QueueServerBackup`), Restore server (latest matching stored server backup), Back up world (`AutomaticBackup.QueueWorldBackup`), and Restore world (latest matching stored world backup). Server/world backup buttons only enqueue background work and return immediately; server backups include server definition plus non-cache Dedicated Server/Magnetar app data, while world backups contain save files and exclude `Sandbox_config.sbc*`.
4. **Automatic backups** — three `MudExpansionPanel` rules: Quasar config, Servers, and Worlds. Each rule has its own enable switch, Frequency select (Hourly/Daily/Weekly), `MudTimePicker` time-of-day (Daily/Weekly), day-of-week select (Weekly), and retention numeric (config keeps last N total; server/world keep last N per server). Panels load expanded only when their rule is enabled. Buttons save all rules or enqueue enabled rules to run immediately in the background.
5. **Stored backups** — shows the resolved configured backup folder with `CopyablePath`, an editable `Backup folder` field bound to `Quasar:BackupDirectory`, Browse (`FolderPickerDialog` with `RequireWorldFolder=false`), Use default, and Save folder actions. A `QUASAR_BACKUP_DIR` environment override makes the editor read-only. The stored-backup table then lists tooltip-wrapped Download (`/api/backup/download/{name}`), Restore and Delete actions in the leftmost column, followed by packed Created / Type / Server / Size columns and a growing Name column, defaulting newest first.

`@code`: subscribes to `BackupSettingsService.Changed`, `BackupSettingsService.BackupDirectoryChanged`, `ServerCatalog.Changed`, `BackupService.Changed`, and `AutomaticBackup.QueuedBackupCompleted`; `LoadSettingsDraft` populates separate time-picker drafts for the three rules; `LoadBackupDirectoryDraft` reads appsettings/env override state for the folder editor; `RefreshServers`, `RefreshBackups` (`BackupService.ListBackups()` sorted by timestamp descending), `SaveSettingsAsync`, `SaveBackupDirectoryAsync`, `BrowseBackupDirectoryAsync`, `UseDefaultBackupDirectoryAsync`, `MakeBackupNowAsync` (`AutomaticBackup.QueueEnabledBackupsNow()`), row-scoped `MakeServerBackupNowAsync` / `MakeWorldBackupNowAsync` queue calls, latest-backup restore helpers, `RestoreFromUploadAsync` / `RestoreFromStoredAsync` (with backup-kind-specific confirm dialogs), `DeleteAsync` (confirm), and `FormatSize` / `FormatBackupType` helpers. `BackupService.Changed` refreshes the stored-backup list as each ZIP is atomically published; queued-job completion shows the success/error snackbar; backup-folder saves refresh the list against the newly active directory.

## Notes
Download endpoints are policy-gated in `Program.cs`. Configuration restore overwrites settings sharing an ID with the backup (merge) and recommends a Quasar restart; server/world restore overwrites files for the target server and asks the operator to restart that server as needed. Manual stored-backup creation is fire-and-forget from the Blazor circuit, so page navigation is not blocked by ZIP creation. Folder saves create the target directory before applying it live; existing ZIPs are not moved between folders.

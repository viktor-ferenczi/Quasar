# Quasar/Components/Pages/Analytics.razor

**Module:** Quasar.Components  **Kind:** Blazor component  **Tier:** 2

## Summary
Routable page (`/analytics`) that renders rolling, interruptible ApexCharts time-series charts for Space Engineers server metrics (SimSpeed, CPU, memory, player count, frame time, PCU, active grids, active entities). Supports multi-server selection, preset and custom time ranges, configurable grid layout, auto-refresh, post-ingest live metric refresh, export trigger, and per-panel layout editing via `AnalyticsPanelDialog`. The full view configuration is persisted in browser local storage under the key `quasar.analytics.view.v2`.

## Structure
- **Route:** `@page "/analytics"`
- **Implements:** `IDisposable`
- **Injected services:** `MetricsStoreService`, `DedicatedServerCatalog`, `AgentRegistry`, `ISnackbar`, `ILocalStorageService`, `IDialogService`, `ThemePreferenceService`, `IJSRuntime`
- **Key UI sections:**
- Toolbar: `MudSelect` for time range (30s/1m/2m/5m/15m/30m/1h/6h/24h/7d/30d/custom), auto-refresh interval; Refresh, Export, Reset layout buttons; Add panel menu for hidden panels.
  - Custom range pickers: `MudDatePicker` + `MudTimePicker` for from/to (shown when range = "custom").
  - Server/Grid settings panel: `MudCheckBox` per discovered server, numeric fields for grid columns, rows, row height, and line capping controls (`Max visible lines`, `Show all selected server lines`).
  - Summary chip row: live aggregate values (SimSpeed, CPU, Memory, Players, PCU, Grids, Entities, Range Avg Sim).
  - Chart grid: CSS grid (`--analytics-grid-columns`, `--analytics-grid-rows`, `--analytics-row-height`) of ApexCharts line-chart cards; each card has a settings icon that opens `AnalyticsPanelDialog`.
- **Significant private types:**
  - `MetricDefinition` record — key, title, subtitle, value selector, availability predicate, requires-zero flag.
  - `ChartModel` record — built chart series, ApexCharts options, layout style, and panel ref.
  - `AnalyticsChartSeries` / `AnalyticsChartPoint` records — per-server line-series data with nullable Y values so missing samples and explicit gaps interrupt the rendered line.
  - `AnalyticsViewConfig` — persisted config (loaded via `ILocalStorageService`).
  - `AnalyticsPanelConfig` — per-panel visibility, order, column/row span.
- **Key methods:**
- `RefreshViewAsync()` — rebuilds server options, normalises selection, resolves time range and viewport-derived point budget, loads sampled data, down-samples and caches transformed points, and builds summary chips plus chart models.
  - Chart render keys include a structural refresh version for time-range/layout/theme changes; live data refreshes keep the same key and use ApexCharts dynamic update APIs after render.
  - `BuildSeriesPoints()` — sorts metric samples by timestamp, inserts null-valued gap points when sample spacing exceeds the disruption threshold, and emits null values for unavailable/non-finite metric samples.
- `CreateChartOptions()` — configures ApexCharts line rendering, a blue-first series palette, datetime axes fixed to the selected time window (keeps moving scale), tooltip formatting, markers, legends, null-point behaviour, fixed 0..100 ms Y-axis for frame-time, and theme mode from `ThemePreferenceService` (light/dark).
  - `ResolveChartHeight()` — derives an explicit pixel chart height from the panel row span and configured row height so ApexCharts does not collapse inside the flex card.
- `ResolveGapThresholdSeconds()` — uses observed sample cadence and a raw baseline to detect missing periods and insert interruption points without false breaks.
- `DownsampleToPointLimit()` — chunk-based averaging decimation to keep each series within budget while preserving the final partial chunk so the newest live samples remain visible.
  - point budget is resolved per chart by viewport width (`chartPxWidth * 1.5`), capped by `[300, 1000]`, then divided by visible server count to keep total chart points bounded.
  - `OpenPanelDialogAsync()` — shows `AnalyticsPanelDialog` and writes back panel settings.
  - `UpdateRefreshTimer()` — creates/disposes a `System.Threading.Timer` for auto-refresh; guarded with `Interlocked.Exchange` to prevent overlapping refreshes.
- **JS interop:** `IJSRuntime` is used for viewport width via `quasarConfigs.getViewportWidth` for dynamic chart point budgets; `JSDisconnectedException` is still handled for local-storage operations and width lookup fallbacks.
- **Event subscriptions:** `MetricsStoreService.Changed`, `AgentRegistry.Changed`, `DedicatedServerCatalog.Changed` — all call `HandleSourceChanged` which marshals to the Blazor thread via `InvokeAsync` and coalesces overlapping refresh requests. The metrics-store event fires after queued samples are ingested, avoiding stale live-refresh reads.

## Dependencies
- [`Quasar/Services/Analytics/MetricsStoreService.cs`](../../Services/Analytics/MetricsStoreService.cs.md)
- [`Quasar/Services/AgentRegistry.cs`](../../Services/AgentRegistry.cs.md)
- [`Quasar/Services/DedicatedServerCatalog.cs`](../../Services/DedicatedServerCatalog.cs.md)
- `Quasar/Components/Pages/AnalyticsPanelDialog.razor`
- ApexCharts (`ApexChart`, `ApexPointSeries`, `ApexChartOptions`)
- MudBlazor (`MudSelect`, `MudNumericField`, `MudDatePicker`, `MudTimePicker`, `MudCheckBox`, `MudChip`, `MudMenu`, `MudButton`)
- Blazored.LocalStorage (`ILocalStorageService`)

## Notes
- Auto-refresh uses an async `PeriodicTimer` loop that marshals back to Blazor's sync context via `InvokeAsync` and calls the same refresh path as the toolbar Refresh button. Source-change refreshes use `Interlocked` flags to coalesce overlapping requests so a post-ingest metrics refresh is not dropped behind an earlier registry refresh.
- ApexCharts components are keyed by panel plus structural refresh version. Live data and timer refreshes keep chart identity stable and call the wrapper's dynamic update APIs after render to avoid flicker, while time-range/layout/theme changes can still remount with fresh series/options.
- ApexCharts receives nullable decimal Y values and `ShowNullDataPoints = false`; null points create visible interruptions instead of connecting across bad or missing metric data. Gap detection is downsample-aware, so a low point limit alone does not split otherwise continuous data.
- Frame time is always rendered on a 0..100 ms Y-axis to keep rare outliers from flattening normal samples against the bottom of the chart.
- Per-chart point budget scales with chart width and visible lines: the same selected time range can be displayed with more detail on wider charts and fewer points when many server lines are visible.
- Large server selections can be capped in-page via `Max visible lines` to control concurrent line rendering, with a `Show all selected server lines` override.
- ApexCharts axis titles are intentionally omitted because the surrounding panel already shows the metric title/subtitle.
- The chart grid is driven entirely by CSS custom properties injected inline (`ChartGridStyle`); on screens narrower than 1280 px the CSS collapses to a single column (`Analytics.razor.css`).
- Local-storage failures (circuit disconnected, JS errors) are silently swallowed so the page still functions.

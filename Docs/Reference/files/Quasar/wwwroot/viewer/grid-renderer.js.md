# Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/grid-renderer.js

**Module:** Quasar.Host  **Kind:** JS  **Tier:** 3

## Summary
Main renderer for grid, context-grid, and asteroid viewer scenes. It computes selected-grid floor alignment, clips context-grid models, logistics masks, damaged-block masks, and voxel terrain to the selected primary grid footprint, renders toggleable logistics and damage overlays, batches/proxies blocks under their owning grid transform, applies current-model matrices and damaged skeleton deformation, builds capped in-scene light groups with projected-shadow budgeting, resolves local Space Engineers models/textures from Content and Mods folders, resolves armor skin and transparent material definitions, applies Space Engineers-style paint/transparency/LCD behavior and captured status-emissive material overrides as visual glow only rather than light sources, progressively rebuilds per-grid model layers while assets load, and procedurally meshes voxel content/material chunks when present.

## Structure

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `renderGridScene(scene)` | Replaces the active grid/voxel scene, computes floor-grid footprint alignment, resolves models, initializes progressive texture stats, creates batches/proxies, updates bounds/camera, and refreshes summary/stat fields. |

Internal sections cover selected-grid-relative transforms, context bounds, shared floor-rectangle clipping helpers, per-grid grouping, logistics overlay construction with context-grid polyline clipping after offline midpoint splitting, damage overlay construction using the projector block's `BuildLevel`/`AccumulatedDamage`/current-damage predicate plus voxel damage chunks filtered by modified sample masks and grouped separately so voxel visibility can hide deformation masks, overlay stats, depth-test-disabled overlay masks/tracers, captured point/spot light creation, projected spot-light shadow selection, proxy-first rendering, local armor skin and transparent material definition parsing, delayed model layer rebuilds, voxel terrain generation, block model transforms, shared geometry/material caches, LCD material replacement, paint/color-mask shader injection, instanced batch flushing, bounded-concurrency model resolution, texture metadata collection, and progressive texture loading.

## Notes
Logistics masks and damaged-block masks render through walls and are rebuilt alongside progressive model-layer rebuilds so they upgrade from fallback boxes to model-shaped masks as local MWM assets become available. In context mode, masks for boundary-crossing context blocks reuse the clipped block geometry path and logistics lines are clipped in viewer-relative X/Z while fully-inside context block masks and primary-grid overlays remain on the normal unclipped path. Damaged-block detection matches the projector marker logic: partially built blocks, blocks with accumulated damage, and blocks with positive current damage are highlighted. Voxel damage masks render from `voxelDamageDeformations`, only polygonize terrain adjacent to changed samples, not whole voxel bodies or every visible terrain chunk, and are hidden when `Show voxels` is unchecked.

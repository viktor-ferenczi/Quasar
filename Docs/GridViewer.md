# Grid Viewer

Quasar includes a first-pass browser grid viewer for live grid entities listed on the Entities page.

## How to open it

1. Open **Entities**.
2. Select a connected server.
3. Refresh the entity list.
4. Click the eye icon beside a grid entity.

The viewer opens `/viewer/entity?agentId=...&entityId=...` and requests a scene snapshot from `/api/viewer/entities/{agentId}/{entityId}/scene`.

## Asset Boundary

Quasar does not serve Space Engineers assets to the browser.

The viewer endpoint returns metadata only:

- grid identity, transform, size, bounds, and static/dynamic state
- scene lighting metadata, including the current in-game sun direction
- loaded voxel body metadata and world bounds for planets, asteroids, moons, and voxel maps
- block definition IDs and block placement
- block cell coordinates, orientation, color mask, skin ID, build state, and integrity
- logical model paths for block definitions, current block models, generated cube parts, and runtime subparts
- logical texture paths only when they are available as metadata
- LCD text surface metadata, including screen material names, selected image IDs, logical image/sprite texture paths, text content, colors, font settings, and sprite draw-layer metadata
- non-fatal warnings

The endpoint must not return:

- raw `.mwm` bytes
- raw texture bytes
- server-rendered LCD texture bytes
- extracted vertices, indices, normals, UVs, or other mesh geometry
- a generic asset download API

## Local Content Folder

The browser asks the user to select their local Space Engineers `Content` folder. The folder should contain `Data`, `Models`, and `Textures` directories.

On Chromium browsers, the viewer uses the File System Access API (`showDirectoryPicker`) and keeps the selected folder handle in browser storage when supported, so the viewer can reuse it on later visits after permission is granted. On Firefox, which does not support `showDirectoryPicker`, the viewer falls back to a browser folder input (`webkitdirectory`) and builds an in-memory view of the selected files. Firefox users must select the Content folder again after a page reload.

The viewer resolves logical model, texture, and SBC data paths case-insensitively where the selected browser file API permits it.

## Current Rendering Behavior

The browser always renders the selected grid in a relative view. The grid's in-game world transform is still used, but the view is re-centered on the grid and rotated into the grid's local frame so large world coordinates do not reduce browser-side precision. Voxel body proxies and the sun direction are transformed through the same relative frame.

The floor grid is scaled to the displayed grid bounds, padded by two major squares, and uses Space Engineers cube-size semantics: 0.5 m sub-squares are always shown, while major lines align to the active grid size (`0.5 m` for small grids and `2.5 m` for large grids).

The viewer parses locally resolved `.mwm` files in the browser and renders mesh geometry for block models, generated cube-part models, and runtime subpart models. Current parsing covers the render mesh tags needed for static geometry (`Vertices`, `Normals`, `TexCoords0`, `MeshParts`, `PatternScale`) and follows `GeometryDataAsset` indirection used by stub MWMs. MWM material parsing also preserves `GLASS` material metadata (`GlassCW`, `GlassCCW`, and smooth-normal flag), which the renderer resolves through the local `Data/TransparentMaterials.sbc` file to the same transparent glass texture/color records used by Space Engineers. MWM triangle indices are converted from Space Engineers' clockwise Direct3D front-face winding to Three.js/WebGL counter-clockwise winding so sun lighting uses the same face orientation as the visible sun line. Regular block models use the exported full local block matrix directly; `ModelOffset` is only applied for legacy snapshots that lack that matrix, avoiding double-offsets on blocks such as hangar doors. Model file resolution/parsing runs with bounded parallelism instead of resolving every listed model one at a time. The viewer first displays temporary proxy boxes so the grid is visible while model files are being resolved and parsed, then progressively rebuilds the model layer on animation frames as parsed assets become available. Scene construction no longer waits for all referenced texture paths to resolve; model geometry appears with generated fallback materials first, then selected material textures fill in progressively. While real models are still loading, unresolved blocks are drawn as instanced proxy batches grouped by opacity instead of one standalone proxy object per block; the proxy solids keep each block's paint color and their outlines are rendered as batched cuboid edge lines.

## Viewer Load Performance

Recent browser diagnostics showed that the remaining slow path is mostly browser-side local `Content` folder work and repeated large proxy-scene rebuilds, not raw MWM parsing.

The production viewer now uses a wider but still bounded set of local filesystem queues: path lookups run with up to `32` concurrent operations, and deferred `getFile()` metadata snapshots run with up to `16`. Model resolution/parsing is capped at `48` workers so the browser stays busy without piling hundreds of model tasks behind narrower filesystem queues.

Progressive model-layer rebuilds are also throttled adaptively. Smaller scenes rebuild sooner so visible geometry appears quickly, while larger scenes wait for more resolved models or a longer maximum delay before rebuilding. This reduces repeated near-identical rebuilds on large grids while preserving the immediate proxy-first load path.

Armor and other generated cube-part models use the game-provided `PatternOffset` metadata from `MyCubeGrid.GetCubeParts(...)`. The browser applies the MWM `PatternScale` to raw model UVs and then applies the cube-part pattern offset using the same final UV expression as the Space Engineers vertex shader. This preserves asymmetric corner and slope triangle atlas layouts such as `LargeBlockArmorCorner` and `LargeBlockArmorSlope2Tip`. Regular block models and runtime subparts do not receive cube-part pattern offsets; all MWM model UVs stay in Space Engineers shader orientation, and loaded textures opt out of Three.js' default vertical flip so panel decals and control-panel textures map the same way as in game.

Model material textures are also resolved from the selected local `Content` folder. Browser-native image files are loaded directly, and DDS material textures are parsed in the browser for common Space Engineers compressed formats including DXT1/DXT3/DXT5, BC4, BC5, and DX10 BC7. Loaded textures use repeat wrapping without Three.js' default `flipY`, matching the Direct3D-oriented UVs stored in Space Engineers MWM assets. DDS upload still depends on the user's browser/GPU exposing the matching WebGL compressed-texture extension, such as `WEBGL_compressed_texture_s3tc`, `EXT_texture_compression_rgtc`, or `EXT_texture_compression_bptc`. Texture color-space classification prefers the material slot name and otherwise uses filename tokens such as `_ng`, `_add`, `_alphamask`, and `_orm`; directory or asset words like `Cubes` or `Armor` do not turn a color-metal texture into a data map. Compressed DDS uploads also preserve an explicit sRGB DX10 format tag even for slots otherwise classified as data, matching Space Engineers content where some normal-gloss files store linear values in sRGB-encoded BC7 blocks. Texture work uses separate limits for path resolution, metadata reads, file reads/DDS parsing, and WebGL upload so filesystem lookups can run wider while upload memory pressure stays bounded. Duplicate logical texture loads and extensionless texture candidate resolutions are coalesced before file metadata is known, then completed textures still use the local file size and `lastModified` cache key for invalidation.

LCD text surfaces are treated the same way: the agent sends only text-surface metadata and logical texture paths for selected LCD images or programmable-block sprite layers. The agent discovers standalone LCD panels through their active panel component and discovers integrated screens through Space Engineers' `IMyMultiTextPanelComponentOwner` interface plus the block definition `ScreenAreas`, covering cockpit/control-seat displays and other screen-capable blocks listed in the local Content definitions. The browser matches LCD surface material names from the active surface to parsed MWM material groups and replaces those materials with either the selected local LCD image texture or a generated canvas texture for text/sprite/background composition. LCD replacement geometry stays depth-tested with the rest of the model, matching the game's material-texture swap behavior; non-transparent screens still write depth, while their vertices receive a tiny normal-space offset to avoid coplanar z-fighting with nearby screen backing geometry. Static LCD images load from the selected local `Content` folder; text content, font/color settings, and programmable-block sprite text layers are sent as metadata so the browser can render characters without receiving the game's offscreen render target. Regular LCD `BackgroundAlpha` is treated as panel metalness rather than canvas opacity; transparent LCDs keep their active screen translucent from `TransparentMaterials.sbc`, use selected non-black background colors even when the saved `BackgroundAlpha` is zero, and leave inactive `TransparentScreenArea*` rotation planes on their default transparent material without block paint tint. Script-generated texture sprites use their logical LCD texture paths and are loaded locally when present. Dedicated-server builds do not recreate built-in client LCD scripts pixel-for-pixel, so surfaces whose visible output exists only as a client-side generated texture may fall back to their background/text metadata.

Transparent LCD replacement surfaces are rendered single-sided, matching the game's transparent material path. This prevents the front and back transparent screen planes from drawing the same LCD output over each other while preserving the inactive rotation planes' default transparent material. Transparent LCD batches also render in the same late transparent layer as glass/holo/shield materials, after the floor grid. This keeps the floor grid consistently tinted by the screen instead of letting Three.js depth-sort the grid and LCD against each other differently as the camera angle changes.

DDS textures used inside LCD canvas composition are decoded through WebGL readback before Canvas2D draws them, because compressed Three.js textures are not browser image objects.

Empty and unpowered LCD screens follow Space Engineers' built-in placeholder rules. Powered `ContentType.NONE` surfaces show `Screen Online` or `Screen Online` wide only when the game-side `UseOnlineTexture` flag is enabled; otherwise the viewer leaves the model's baked screen material unchanged. Unpowered surfaces use `Screen Offline` or the wide offline placeholder. Blocks that define `MaterialNamesToHideWhenOffline` also omit those model material groups while the block's LCD surfaces are offline, matching holo, transparent, and special screen backings that disappear in game when power is lost.

LCD text uses the real Space Engineers bitmap font data for every built-in font exposed by the LCD font menu: `Debug`, `Red`, `Green`, `Blue`, `White`, `DarkBlue`, `UrlNormal`, `UrlHighlight`, `ErrorMessageBoxCaption`, `ErrorMessageBoxText`, `InfoMessageBoxCaption`, `InfoMessageBoxText`, `ScreenCaption`, `GameCredits`, `LoadingScreen`, `BuildInfo`, `BuildInfoHighlight`, and `Monospace`. The browser maps those definitions to the same first-pass atlases and color masks used by `Fonts.sbc`: shadowed definitions use `Fonts/white_shadow/FontDataPA.xml`, white-family definitions use `Fonts/white/FontDataPA.xml`, and `Monospace` uses `Fonts/monospace/FontDataPA.xml`. The atlas pages are loaded from the selected local `Content` folder, decoded once through WebGL readback, unpremultiplied for `FontDataPA` before Canvas2D tinting, and drawn with the game's advance, bearing draw offset, line-height, per-font color mask, and `144/185` GUI text scale. LCD canvas composition uses the game's `SurfaceSize` layout coordinates and then maps that result into the raw render texture, matching non-square screen aspect handling on curved and round LCD panels. Unknown LCD font names still fall back to the `Debug` definition.

Applied block paint is rendered client-side from the scene `colourMaskHsv` metadata. Instanced model batches carry paint through per-instance color data instead of allocating a repeated per-vertex paint buffer for every rendered block. For textured models, the viewer uses Space Engineers-style color masking: base color comes from `ColorMetalTexture`/diffuse textures, paint strength comes from `AddMapsTexture`/extension-map alpha, and `*_alphamask.dds` is treated only as alpha/cutout data rather than a paint mask. When the selected local Content folder contains `Data/AssetModifiers/ArmorModifiers.sbc`, the browser resolves block `skinSubtypeId` values to the same material/location texture overrides used by the game client and swaps `ColorMetal`, `NormalGloss`, `Extensions`, and `Alphamask` paths before loading material textures. Alpha-masked model techniques are rendered as depth-writing cutouts instead of blended transparent sheets, and glass/holo/shield techniques render as blended materials with depth writes disabled to reduce self-overlap artifacts. `GLASS` mesh parts and named transparent screen-area materials use transparent-material texture/color data from `TransparentMaterials.sbc` and do not consume the block paint mask, so painted frames can still be colored while transparent glass and transparent LCD planes keep their normal color. When a local model cannot be parsed, proxy boxes use the same block paint color as a visual fallback.

The viewer statistics panel reports unique model assets listed by the scene, model files found locally, parsed models, missing models, LCD surface count, and the equivalent texture counts discovered from scene texture metadata and locally parsed MWM material groups. Texture counts are unique by logical texture path; `loaded` counts textures the browser successfully decoded/uploaded, while `failed` covers locally found textures that could not be used, such as unsupported DDS/WebGL compression combinations. Texture found/missing/loaded/failed counts update progressively as visible/shared materials request textures.

The stats panel exposes timing counters for the main asset pipeline: scene snapshot fetch, model path resolution, local file metadata reads, MWM file reads, MWM parse time, total model resolution, texture path resolution, DDS file reads, DDS parse time, and compressed texture upload validation/init. Path resolution covers handle lookup only; local file metadata reads cover `getFile()` snapshots; byte-read timings cover `arrayBuffer()` work. Successful DDS loads are written to the browser console at debug level instead of rebuilding the visible warning log for every texture; the visible log batches DOM updates and is primarily for warnings/fallbacks.

Loaded voxel bodies are shown as metadata-only proxies: planets use a wire sphere from the in-game radius metadata, and other voxel maps use their world bounds. The `Show voxels` toggle controls these proxies. Quasar still does not transmit voxel storage samples or generated voxel mesh geometry.

The `Show sun` toggle controls the directional sun light and marker. When enabled, the sun position comes from `MySector.DirectionToSunNormalized` in the running game and is transformed into the grid-relative view; the visible sun ray points back toward the grid along the same direction used by the directional light. The sun-on ambient fill is intentionally low and uniform. When disabled, the viewer uses stronger uniform ambient and environment lighting so the grid remains readable without directional sun.

The stats panel also includes live WebGL and viewport counters such as draw calls, triangles, lines, points, GPU geometries/textures, shader programs, renderables, visible objects, culled objects, meshes, sprites, and lights.

Missing or unparseable local models and missing or unloadable textures are non-fatal. The viewer logs warnings and keeps the scene visible with proxy boxes and generated fallback materials where needed. Local Content lookups are cached in memory for the current selected folder, including resolved paths, misses, in-flight full-path lookups, typed directory/file child lookups, and case-insensitive directory entry maps. Intermediate path segments only probe directories and final path segments only probe files, avoiding slow wrong-kind probes such as treating `.mwm` filenames as directories. `getFile()` metadata snapshots are deferred until size, mtime, or bytes are needed and are cached separately by canonical path. Once a directory has been enumerated, later child lookups use the cached lowercase map first to avoid repeated expensive failed exact-case probes. Firefox's folder-input fallback feeds the same cache through virtual directory/file handles backed by the selected `File` objects. Cache diagnostics in the stats panel include path hits/misses, exact probes, enumerations, case-fallback hits, negative-cache hits, and metadata-cache hits. The caches are cleared when a different Content folder is selected or restored.

## Mods

Modded grids require matching local mod content. If the selected local `Content` folder does not include the referenced mod assets, affected blocks fall back to proxy rendering and warnings are shown.

## Server-Side Notes

The scene snapshot is captured by `Quasar.Agent` on the game thread through the existing agent command/result WebSocket flow. The command is `GetEntityRenderScene`, and the shared DTOs live in `Magnetar.Protocol`.

The dedicated-server agent deliberately does not reference client render assemblies to resolve skin texture-change payloads. It sends `SkinSubtypeId` and other block metadata; local browser-side content handling resolves base-game armor skin texture overrides from the selected Content folder.

# Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/state.js

**Module:** Quasar.Host  **Kind:** JS  **Tier:** 3

## Summary
Shared mutable runtime state and DOM-element cache for the standalone grid viewer ES modules. It centralizes Three.js objects including the directional sun, its target, optional sun marker and clipping helpers, captured grid light groups, logistics and damaged-block overlay groups, and voxel group, renderer animation/teardown state, FPS sampling state, camera/fly-mode state, current scene/bounds, voxel and context URL support state, logical context bounds, context clip bounds, context grid IDs, floor-grid alignment metadata, loading/status overlay and download-control DOM elements, local Content and global Mods folder handles or folder-input adapters, active scene mod roots, model/texture caches and cache generation, progressive texture stats, timing counters, and displayed stats. Grid-size defaults are assigned by renderer/scene modules so this state module does not import `scene.js` and avoids a circular ES-module dependency.

## Structure

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `state` | Singleton object holding renderer/scene/camera references, animation and disposal flags, FPS sampling fields, groups including logistics, damaged-block, and clipping overlays, controls, loaded-scene metadata including voxel/context support, logical context bounds, context clip bounds, floor-grid alignment, selected asset folders, active mod roots, cache maps and generations, texture stats, timing counters, and UI stats. |
| `els` | Object populated with commonly used DOM elements from `index.html`. |
| `cacheElements()` | Fills `els` by looking up all required viewer element IDs. |

## Dependencies
- Browser DOM APIs.

## Notes
This file intentionally keeps cross-module viewer state explicit rather than introducing a framework store for the static viewer page.

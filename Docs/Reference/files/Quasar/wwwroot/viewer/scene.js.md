# Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/scene.js

**Module:** Quasar.Host  **Kind:** JS  **Tier:** 3

## Summary
Three.js scene, camera, lighting, controls, animation, interaction, and render-stat runtime for the standalone grid/asteroid viewer. It owns renderer setup, shadow-map configuration, orbit/free-fly camera behavior, floor grid generation, relative-space bounds tracking, ambient/sun/grid lighting application, object disposal, viewport resizing, block/voxel/logistics/damage hover readouts, logistics hover focus, same-grid damaged-block hover focus, and per-frame stats rendering.

## Structure

Key exports:

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SMALL_GRID_CUBE_SIZE` / `LARGE_GRID_CUBE_SIZE` / `ASTEROID_GRID_CUBE_SIZE` | Shared floor-grid sizing constants for small-grid, large-grid, and asteroid-scale viewer modes. |
| `initScene()` | Creates the scene, renderer, camera, controls, lighting, floor grid, pointer handlers, and resize observer. |
| `animate(time)` | Per-frame render loop that updates controls/free-fly movement, renders the scene, and refreshes render stats. |
| `replaceFloorGrid(bounds, gridSize, alignment = null)` | Rebuilds the scaled floor grid using SE small/large/asteroid grid cell semantics, optional per-axis lattice offsets, and updates fog density from the floor span. |
| `floorGridLayout(bounds, gridSize, alignment)` | Computes the snapped floor-grid cell layout used by both floor rendering and client-side voxel clipping. |
| `fitCameraToScene()` | Frames the active grid bounds and updates camera clipping planes/orbit target. |
| `updateSceneBounds(refit = false)` | Recomputes displayed relative-space bounds and refreshes the floor grid and sun marker placement. |
| `updateLighting()` | Applies the lighting toggle state to ambient fill, the directional sun, grid light group, and sun marker helpers. |
| `updateSunLightPosition()` | Positions the directional sun, target, marker, ray indicator, and fitted orthographic shadow camera in relative-grid space. |
| `disposeObjectTree(root)` | Disposes geometries and materials below a scene object. |
| `setCameraMode(mode)` | Switches between orbit and free-fly camera modes. |

## Dependencies
- `three` and `three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js`.
- [`Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/state.js`](state.js.md) for global viewer runtime state and cached DOM elements.
- [`Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/geometry.js`](geometry.js.md) for bounds conversion.

## Notes
The hover path prioritizes visible overlay intersections before regular block/voxel readouts and ignores hidden mutually exclusive overlays. Damaged-block focus brightens damaged masks on the hovered block's grid and dims damaged masks on other visible grids.

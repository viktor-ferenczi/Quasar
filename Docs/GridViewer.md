# Grid Viewer

Quasar includes a first-pass browser grid viewer for live grid entities listed on the Entities page.

## How to open it

1. Open **Entities**.
2. Select a connected server.
3. Refresh the entity list.
4. Click the eye icon beside a grid entity.

The viewer opens `/viewer/entity?agentId=...&entityId=...` and requests a scene snapshot from `/api/viewer/entities/{agentId}/{entityId}/scene`.

## Asset Boundary

Quasar does not serve Space Engineers assets to the browser.

The viewer endpoint returns metadata only:

- grid identity, transform, size, bounds, and static/dynamic state
- scene lighting metadata, including the current in-game sun direction
- loaded voxel body metadata and world bounds for planets, asteroids, moons, and voxel maps
- block definition IDs and block placement
- block cell coordinates, orientation, color mask, skin ID, build state, and integrity
- logical model paths for block definitions, current block models, generated cube parts, and runtime subparts
- logical texture paths only when they are available as metadata
- non-fatal warnings

The endpoint must not return:

- raw `.mwm` bytes
- raw texture bytes
- extracted vertices, indices, normals, UVs, or other mesh geometry
- a generic asset download API

## Local Content Folder

The browser asks the user to select their local Space Engineers `Content` folder. The folder should contain `Data`, `Models`, and `Textures` directories.

On Chromium browsers, the viewer uses the File System Access API (`showDirectoryPicker`) and keeps the selected folder handle in browser storage when supported, so the viewer can reuse it on later visits after permission is granted. On Firefox, which does not support `showDirectoryPicker`, the viewer falls back to a browser folder input (`webkitdirectory`) and builds an in-memory view of the selected files. Firefox users must select the Content folder again after a page reload.

The viewer resolves logical model and texture paths case-insensitively where the selected browser file API permits it.

## Current Rendering Behavior

The browser always renders the selected grid in a relative view. The grid's in-game world transform is still used, but the view is re-centered on the grid and rotated into the grid's local frame so large world coordinates do not reduce browser-side precision. Voxel body proxies and the sun direction are transformed through the same relative frame.

The floor grid is scaled to the displayed grid bounds, padded by two major squares, and uses Space Engineers cube-size semantics: 0.5 m sub-squares are always shown, while major lines align to the active grid size (`0.5 m` for small grids and `2.5 m` for large grids).

The viewer parses locally resolved `.mwm` files in the browser and renders mesh geometry for block models, generated cube-part models, and runtime subpart models. Current parsing covers the render mesh tags needed for static geometry (`Vertices`, `Normals`, `TexCoords0`, `MeshParts`, `PatternScale`) and follows `GeometryDataAsset` indirection used by stub MWMs. MWM triangle indices are converted from Space Engineers' clockwise Direct3D front-face winding to Three.js/WebGL counter-clockwise winding so sun lighting uses the same face orientation as the visible sun line. Regular block models use the exported full local block matrix directly; `ModelOffset` is only applied for legacy snapshots that lack that matrix, avoiding double-offsets on blocks such as hangar doors. Model file resolution/parsing runs with bounded parallelism instead of resolving every listed model one at a time. The viewer first displays temporary proxy boxes so the grid is visible while model files are being resolved and parsed, then progressively rebuilds the model layer on animation frames as parsed assets become available. Scene construction no longer waits for all referenced texture paths to resolve; model geometry appears with generated fallback materials first, then selected material textures fill in progressively. While real models are still loading, unresolved blocks are drawn as instanced proxy batches grouped by opacity instead of one standalone proxy object per block; the proxy solids keep each block's paint color and their outlines are rendered as batched cuboid edge lines.

## Viewer Load Performance

Recent browser diagnostics showed that the remaining slow path is mostly browser-side local `Content` folder work and repeated large proxy-scene rebuilds, not raw MWM parsing.

The production viewer now uses a wider but still bounded set of local filesystem queues: path lookups run with up to `32` concurrent operations, and deferred `getFile()` metadata snapshots run with up to `16`. Model resolution/parsing is capped at `48` workers so the browser stays busy without piling hundreds of model tasks behind narrower filesystem queues.

Progressive model-layer rebuilds are also throttled adaptively. Smaller scenes rebuild sooner so visible geometry appears quickly, while larger scenes wait for more resolved models or a longer maximum delay before rebuilding. This reduces repeated near-identical rebuilds on large grids while preserving the immediate proxy-first load path.

Armor and other generated cube-part models use the game-provided `PatternOffset` metadata from `MyCubeGrid.GetCubeParts(...)`. The browser applies the MWM `PatternScale` to model UVs and then applies the cube-part pattern offset before sampling wrapped material textures, matching Space Engineers' armor texture tiling and adjacent-block atlas variation more closely. Regular block models and runtime subparts do not receive cube-part pattern offsets.

Model material textures are also resolved from the selected local `Content` folder. Browser-native image files are loaded directly, and DDS material textures are parsed in the browser for common Space Engineers compressed formats including DXT1/DXT3/DXT5, BC4, BC5, and DX10 BC7. DDS upload still depends on the user's browser/GPU exposing the matching WebGL compressed-texture extension, such as `WEBGL_compressed_texture_s3tc`, `EXT_texture_compression_rgtc`, or `EXT_texture_compression_bptc`. Texture color-space classification prefers the material slot name and otherwise uses filename tokens such as `_ng`, `_add`, `_alphamask`, and `_orm`; directory or asset words like `Cubes` or `Armor` do not turn a color-metal texture into a data map. Texture work uses separate limits for path resolution, metadata reads, file reads/DDS parsing, and WebGL upload so filesystem lookups can run wider while upload memory pressure stays bounded. Duplicate logical texture loads and extensionless texture candidate resolutions are coalesced before file metadata is known, then completed textures still use the local file size and `lastModified` cache key for invalidation.

Applied block paint is rendered client-side from the scene `colourMaskHsv` metadata. Instanced model batches carry paint through per-instance color data instead of allocating a repeated per-vertex paint buffer for every rendered block. For textured models, the viewer uses Space Engineers-style color masking: base color comes from `ColorMetalTexture`/diffuse textures, paint strength comes from `AddMapsTexture`/extension-map alpha, and `*_alphamask.dds` is treated only as alpha/cutout data rather than a paint mask. Alpha-masked model techniques are rendered as depth-writing cutouts instead of blended transparent sheets, and glass/holo/shield techniques render as blended materials with depth writes disabled to reduce self-overlap artifacts. When a local model cannot be parsed, proxy boxes use the same block paint color as a visual fallback.

The viewer statistics panel reports unique model assets listed by the scene, model files found locally, parsed models, missing models, and the equivalent texture counts discovered from scene texture metadata and locally parsed MWM material groups. Texture counts are unique by logical texture path; `loaded` counts textures the browser successfully decoded/uploaded, while `failed` covers locally found textures that could not be used, such as unsupported DDS/WebGL compression combinations. Texture found/missing/loaded/failed counts update progressively as visible/shared materials request textures.

The stats panel exposes timing counters for the main asset pipeline: scene snapshot fetch, model path resolution, local file metadata reads, MWM file reads, MWM parse time, total model resolution, texture path resolution, DDS file reads, DDS parse time, and compressed texture upload validation/init. Path resolution covers handle lookup only; local file metadata reads cover `getFile()` snapshots; byte-read timings cover `arrayBuffer()` work. Successful DDS loads are written to the browser console at debug level instead of rebuilding the visible warning log for every texture; the visible log batches DOM updates and is primarily for warnings/fallbacks.

Loaded voxel bodies are shown as metadata-only proxies: planets use a wire sphere from the in-game radius metadata, and other voxel maps use their world bounds. The `Show voxels` toggle controls these proxies. Quasar still does not transmit voxel storage samples or generated voxel mesh geometry.

The `Show sun` toggle controls the directional sun light and marker. When enabled, the sun position comes from `MySector.DirectionToSunNormalized` in the running game and is transformed into the grid-relative view; the visible sun ray points back toward the grid along the same direction used by the directional light. The sun-on ambient fill is intentionally low and uniform. When disabled, the viewer uses stronger uniform ambient and environment lighting so the grid remains readable without directional sun.

The stats panel also includes live WebGL and viewport counters such as draw calls, triangles, lines, points, GPU geometries/textures, shader programs, renderables, visible objects, culled objects, meshes, sprites, and lights.

Missing or unparseable local models and missing or unloadable textures are non-fatal. The viewer logs warnings and keeps the scene visible with proxy boxes and generated fallback materials where needed. Local Content lookups are cached in memory for the current selected folder, including resolved paths, misses, in-flight full-path lookups, typed directory/file child lookups, and case-insensitive directory entry maps. Intermediate path segments only probe directories and final path segments only probe files, avoiding slow wrong-kind probes such as treating `.mwm` filenames as directories. `getFile()` metadata snapshots are deferred until size, mtime, or bytes are needed and are cached separately by canonical path. Once a directory has been enumerated, later child lookups use the cached lowercase map first to avoid repeated expensive failed exact-case probes. Firefox's folder-input fallback feeds the same cache through virtual directory/file handles backed by the selected `File` objects. Cache diagnostics in the stats panel include path hits/misses, exact probes, enumerations, case-fallback hits, negative-cache hits, and metadata-cache hits. The caches are cleared when a different Content folder is selected or restored.

## Mods

Modded grids require matching local mod content. If the selected local `Content` folder does not include the referenced mod assets, affected blocks fall back to proxy rendering and warnings are shown.

## Server-Side Notes

The scene snapshot is captured by `Quasar.Agent` on the game thread through the existing agent command/result WebSocket flow. The command is `GetEntityRenderScene`, and the shared DTOs live in `Magnetar.Protocol`.

The dedicated-server agent deliberately does not reference client render assemblies to resolve skin texture-change payloads. It sends `SkinSubtypeId` and other block metadata; local browser-side content handling is responsible for visual fallbacks and any future local skin-definition resolution.

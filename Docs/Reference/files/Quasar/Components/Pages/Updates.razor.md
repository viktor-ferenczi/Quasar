# Quasar/Components/Pages/Updates.razor

**Module:** Quasar.Components  **Kind:** component  **Tier:** 2

## Summary

Routable MudBlazor page at `/settings/updates` for checking, staging, activating, and rolling back Quasar UI worker releases. It shows current update status from `QuasarUpdateService`, separates selectable Quasar UI releases from launcher candidates, exposes manual check/stage/activate actions for the selected UI worker version, shows launcher update availability, displays configured GitHub release source and asset names, and provides controls for including prerelease versions plus choosing automatic or manual UI staging.

## Structure

Route: `/settings/updates`  
Authorization: `QuasarPolicyNames.CanManageSecurity`

**Injected services**

- `QuasarUpdateService` — snapshot source and action API
- `QuasarUpdateOptions` — configured GitHub owner/repository/assets/check interval
- `WebServiceOptions` — current UI and Bootstrap versions
- `ISnackbar` — user feedback for update actions
- `IDialogService` — confirmation dialog before enabling prerelease updates

**Key members**

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `OnInitialized()` / `Dispose()` | Subscribes/unsubscribes to `UpdateService.Changed` and initializes `_snapshot`. |
| `CheckNowAsync()` | Runs an immediate release check through `QuasarUpdateService.CheckNowAsync()`. |
| `HandleSelectedWebVersionChanged(...)` | Selects the UI release to stage/install from the discovered list, including older rollback targets. |
| `StageAsync()` | Downloads and stages the selected Quasar UI release unless it is already current or staged. |
| `ActivateAsync()` | Requests staged UI activation; the update service promotes the staged payload into the managed active-release directory and writes the active-release pointer. Older staged releases are allowed for rollback. |
| `HandleIncludePrereleaseChanged(bool)` | Confirms before enabling prerelease updates, persists the stream setting through `QuasarUpdateService`, refreshes the release list, and shows a strong warning while prereleases are enabled. |
| `HandleAutoStageWebUpdatesChanged(bool)` | Persists whether release checks should automatically download/stage a newer UI release or only queue releases for manual staging. |
| `RunBusyAsync(...)` | Shared busy-state/error/snackbar wrapper for the three actions. |
| `GetStatusSeverity()` | Maps `QuasarUpdateStatus` to MudBlazor alert severity. |
| `FormatBootstrapVersion()` | Shows the Bootstrap launcher version when the worker was started by Bootstrap, otherwise reports that Bootstrap is not managing this worker. |
| `FormatWebReleaseOption(...)` / `FormatWebReleaseStatus(...)` | Labels selectable UI releases as current, newer, rollback, prerelease, and/or staged. |

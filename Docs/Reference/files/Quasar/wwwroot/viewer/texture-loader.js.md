# Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/texture-loader.js

**Module:** Quasar.Host  **Kind:** JS  **Tier:** 3

## Summary
Browser-side texture resolver/loader for the grid viewer. It resolves logical texture paths against the selected local Content folder, caches extension-candidate hits and misses for the active Content folder, coalesces duplicate logical texture loads before file metadata is known, caches completed textures by resolved path/size/mtime/color role, loads browser-native images, parses common SE DDS compressed formats, and throttles path resolution, file reads, and WebGL upload/init separately.

## Structure

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `resolveTextureAsset(asset)` | Resolves a texture asset DTO to a local file when possible. |
| `loadTexture(logicalPath, slot = "")` | Loads one logical texture for a material slot, using logical in-flight coalescing and final file metadata caching. |
| `resolveTextureFile(logicalPath)` | Tries and caches extension candidates (`.dds`, image extensions, raw path) through the Content folder resolver. |

Internal sections implement DDS header parsing for DXT1/DXT3/DXT5, BC4, BC5, DX10 BC7 variants, mip data slicing, `THREE.CompressedTexture` creation, color-space/wrap/anisotropy setup, WebGL extension checks, upload preflight with `renderer.initTexture`, active-generation texture path candidate caches, async queue throttles, and timing counter updates.

## Dependencies
- `three`.
- [`Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/content-folder.js`](content-folder.js.md) for local file resolution.
- [`Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/state.js`](state.js.md) for renderer access, texture caches, in-flight logical loads, and timing counters.

## Notes
Missing logical textures throw errors marked with `isMissingLocalTexture` so `grid-renderer.js` can distinguish local misses from decode/upload failures in progressive stats. File metadata is requested through the resolved handle only after path resolution succeeds, keeping texture path timing separate from `getFile()` metadata timing and byte-read timing.

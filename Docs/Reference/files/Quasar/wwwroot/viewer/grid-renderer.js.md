# Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/grid-renderer.js

**Module:** Quasar.Host  **Kind:** JS  **Tier:** 3

## Summary
Main renderer for grid, context-grid, and asteroid viewer scenes. It computes selected-grid floor alignment, derives the selected-grid-relative 3D context clip prism from context relative bounds and floor-grid snapping, clips ordinary context-grid models, logistics masks/lines, damaged-block masks, and voxel terrain to that prism, renders toggleable logistics and damage overlays, prebuilds authored MWM LOD model batches and unclipped damage/logistics model masks under Three.js `LOD` objects so the renderer switches visibility per frame, batches/proxies blocks under their owning grid transform, applies current-model matrices and damaged skeleton deformation, builds capped in-scene light groups with projected-shadow budgeting, resolves local Space Engineers models/textures from Content and Mods folders, resolves armor skin and transparent material definitions, applies Space Engineers-style paint/transparency/LCD behavior and captured status-emissive material overrides as visual glow only rather than light sources, preloads model/LCD/voxel textures before swapping in a reloaded scene while ignoring cache-invalidated stale loads, prunes cached textures not referenced by the active scene, and procedurally meshes voxel content/material chunks with material-specific fallback colors when present.

## Structure

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `renderGridScene(scene, options)` | Prepares a replacement grid/voxel scene by computing floor-grid footprint alignment, resolving models, reporting load progress, preloading discovered textures, creating batches/proxies, swapping the prepared groups into the active Three.js scene, updating bounds/camera, and refreshing summary/stat fields. |

Internal sections cover selected-grid-relative transforms, logical context bounds, 3D context clip bounds, shared volume clipping helpers, per-grid grouping, logistics overlay construction with context-grid polyline clipping after offline midpoint splitting, damage overlay construction using the projector block's `BuildLevel`/`AccumulatedDamage`/current-damage predicate plus voxel damage chunks filtered by modified sample masks and grouped separately so voxel visibility can hide deformation masks, overlay stats, depth-test-disabled overlay masks/tracers, captured point/spot light creation, projected spot-light shadow selection, prepared scene swapping with animation-frame yields between final post-texture phases and pre-fade camera framing, local armor skin and transparent material definition parsing, voxel terrain generation with hardcoded vanilla material fallback colors, block model transforms, opaque block proxy fallback boxes with darker paint-derived inset edge borders instead of wireframe highlights, Three.js `LOD` construction grouped by authored model distance tables with Space Engineers' skinned cube-instancing distance multiplier and 10% hysteresis for both model batches and overlay model masks, shared geometry/material caches, LCD material replacement, paint/color-mask shader injection, instanced batch flushing, bounded-concurrency model resolution with immediate progress reporting on each completed asset, texture metadata collection, invalidated texture-load filtering, active-scene texture collection for cache pruning, and preload-backed texture binding.

## Notes
Logistics masks and damaged-block masks render through walls and are rebuilt alongside progressive model-layer rebuilds so they upgrade from fallback boxes to model-shaped masks as local MWM assets become available. Unclipped model-shaped masks use authored LOD variants when present, matching the visible model fit as camera-distance LODs switch. In context mode, masks for boundary-crossing context blocks reuse the clipped block geometry path and logistics lines are clipped in viewer-relative X/Y/Z while fully-inside context block masks and primary-grid overlays remain on the normal unclipped path. The statistics panel reports submitted model triangles split by source, live visible LOD instance distribution, and authored LOD coverage. Damaged-block detection matches the projector marker logic: partially built blocks, blocks with accumulated damage, and blocks with positive current damage are highlighted. Voxel damage masks render from `voxelDamageDeformations`, only polygonize terrain adjacent to changed samples, not whole voxel bodies or every visible terrain chunk, and are hidden when `Show voxels` is unchecked.

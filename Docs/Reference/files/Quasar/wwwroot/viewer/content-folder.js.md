# Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/content-folder.js

**Module:** Quasar.Host  **Kind:** JS  **Tier:** 3

## Summary
Browser File System Access helper for the grid viewer's local Space Engineers `Content` folder. It restores or stores the selected folder handle in IndexedDB, validates the expected `Data`, `Models`, and `Textures` directories, resolves logical asset paths through a lazy case-insensitive path cache, and separates path lookup from `getFile()` metadata snapshots.

## Structure

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `restoreContentFolder()` | Loads the persisted directory handle and reuses it when read permission is already granted. |
| `pickContentFolder()` | Opens `showDirectoryPicker`, validates the selection, stores the handle, and clears asset caches. |
| `looksLikeContentFolder(handle)` | Checks for the top-level directories expected in an SE `Content` folder. |
| `resolveContentFile(logicalPath)` | Normalizes a logical asset path, tries known extension candidates, and returns `{ logicalPath, canonicalPath, fileHandle, getFile }` or `null`. |
| `clearContentFolderCaches()` | Clears resolved path, miss, in-flight lookup, and lowercase directory-entry caches. |
| `getContentFolderCacheGeneration()` | Returns the active Content-cache generation for dependent candidate caches. |

## Dependencies
- [`Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/state.js`](state.js.md) for selected folder state and texture cache reset.
- [`Quasar/wwwroot/viewer/logging.js`](logging.js.md) for selection status logging.
- Browser File System Access API and IndexedDB.

## Notes
Path resolution uses typed child lookups: intermediate segments call `getDirectoryHandle()` only, final segments call `getFileHandle()` only, and case-insensitive fallback enumerates a directory only after an exact typed lookup misses. Directory nodes preserve canonical casing, cache lowercase child maps, coalesce in-flight child lookups, and remember negative file/directory misses so repeated bad candidates avoid filesystem calls.

Resolved path hits and misses are cached by slash-normalized lowercase path. The returned `getFile()` function defers browser metadata snapshots until a loader needs size, mtime, or bytes, then caches the `File` by canonical path with a separate metadata queue. The stats panel receives cache diagnostics for path hits/misses, exact probes, directory enumeration, case fallback, negative-cache hits, and metadata-cache hits. Caches are intentionally in-memory and are cleared when the active Content folder changes.

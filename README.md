# Quasar

Quasar is a supervisor and management stack for **Space Engineers** (version 1)
dedicated servers. It runs as a Blazor Server web app that supervises multiple DS
processes on a single host — starting, stopping, health-checking, configuring, and
auto-updating them through goal-state reconciliation — while an in-process plugin
(`Quasar.Agent`) attaches to each server to report telemetry and execute commands.

It runs on **Linux** (systemd service) and **Windows** (Scheduled Task), in
foreground console or unattended background mode.

Each server uses the **[Magnetar](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/Magnetar)** plugin loader and launcher.
Quasar deploys an agent plugin which connects back to Quasar.

Quasar downloads Magnetar and the Dedicated Server builds automatically and caches it locally until there is an update.

You can register new plugins by making PRs to the [MagnetarHub](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/MagnetarHub).

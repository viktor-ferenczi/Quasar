# Quasar

Quasar is a supervisor and management stack for **Space Engineers** (version 1)
dedicated servers. It runs as a Blazor Server web app that supervises multiple DS
processes on a single host — starting, stopping, health-checking, configuring, and
auto-updating them through goal-state reconciliation — while an in-process plugin
(`Quasar.Agent`) attaches to each server to report telemetry and execute commands.

It runs on **Linux** (systemd service) and **Windows** (Scheduled Task), in
foreground console or unattended background mode.

Managed servers run under
**[Magnetar](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/Magnetar)** — the Space Engineers
plugin loader and launcher whose Plugin SDK contracts Quasar speaks. Quasar
downloads the required Magnetar builds automatically.

You can register new plugins by making PRs to the [MagnetarHub](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/magnetarhub).
